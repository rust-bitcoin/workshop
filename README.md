Rust Bitcoin Presentations
==========================

This repository is for holding material people use to do presentations (talks, workshops) on
`rust-bitcoin`, the purpose is to share resources and time invested.

Currently one branch per conference so the presenters have full control over their material.

Not sure exactly what to put on `master` branch yet.

## Presentations
